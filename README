Why do this?
Borne out of frustration from trying to get blinky (which I truly love the simplicity of) running with libusb on Windows.  I figured a pure .NET version might be simpler and gave me something to code.

Surely this exists?
It does, it's called blinky.  I'm lazy though, and gave up quickly after having trouble getting it to work on Windows.  By all means though, on a UNIX-y platform, use blinky, it's great.

How do I use this?
I'll put some examples up as things progress, for now you'll just have to work it out yourself.
